    """Forward an email to recipients listed in a CSV file in batches of 500 (Outlook BCC limit).

    This function uses an email identified by message_id as a template and forwards it to multiple recipients
    from a CSV file. The email is sent via BCC to protect recipient privacy.

    Args:
        message_id: The Outlook entry_id of the email to use as template
        csv_path: Path to CSV file containing recipient email addresses in 'email' column
        custom_text: Optional custom text to prepend to the email body

    CSV Format:
        The CSV file must contain a column named 'email' with recipient email addresses.
        Example:
        ```
        email
        user1@example.com
        user2@example.com
        user3@example.com
        ```

    Returns:
        dict: Response containing batch sending results
        {
            "type": "text",
            "text": "Batch sending completed for X recipients in Y batches: [detailed results]"
        }

    Note:
        - Maximum 500 recipients per batch due to Outlook BCC limitations
        - Invalid email addresses in the CSV will be skipped with warnings
        - The email is sent as BCC to protect recipient privacy
        - Recipients will see it as a forwarded email with "FW:" prefix
        - This function forwards existing emails, it does not compose new ones
