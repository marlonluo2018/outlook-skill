# Outlook Skill

> **⚠️ ALL emails use HTML format:** `<p>text</p>`, `<br>`, `<strong>bold</strong>`

## Commands

### Find Recent Emails
```bash
py -3 scripts/outlook_skill.py find-recent --days 7
```
- Default: **Inbox only** (your sent emails are tracked in task files)
- Shows: To/CC, attachments, body preview, folder indicator (📥/📤)
- `--days`: 1-365 (default: 7)
- `--folder`: override folder (rarely needed)

### Find Emails
```bash
py -3 scripts/outlook_skill.py find --type subject --query "Name" --days 14
```
- Default folder depends on `--type`:
  - `sender`, `subject`, `body` → **Inbox** only
  - `recipient` → **Sent Items** only
- `--type`: subject, sender, recipient, body
- `recipient` search matches recipients in sent mail using **To + CC** fields and resolved Outlook recipient names/addresses
- `--query`: search text (required)
- `--days`: 1-365 for direct `find` searches (default: 14)
- `--folders`: use only when explicitly searching across folders (searches Inbox + Sent Items)
- **AI guidance:** start with a small recent window first (usually 7-14 days)
- If the first search does not find the email, widen the date range gradually and make the query more specific before broadening further
- Use [`find-thread`](assistant_brain/skills/outlook-skill/SKILL.md:49) or [`find-related`](assistant_brain/skills/outlook-skill/SKILL.md:59) when older or broader history is needed

### Find Thread
```bash
py -3 scripts/outlook_skill.py find-thread "<email_id>"
```
- **Auto-searches Inbox + Sent Items** — thread completeness requires both
- Finds ALL emails sharing the same ConversationID
- Subjects can differ (RE:/Fwd: prefixes, topic changes don't matter)
- Uses a reliable full-folder scan path for conversation matching when Outlook filtering is inconsistent
- Results sorted chronologically (oldest first)

### Find Related Emails
```bash
py -3 scripts/outlook_skill.py find-related "<email_id>"
```
- **Auto-searches Inbox + Sent Items** — multi-strategy needs full data
- Strategies: thread (★5) + sender (★3) + keyword (★2)
- Results sorted by relevance
- Multi-strategy search for emails related to a given email:
  - **thread** (★5): Same ConversationID
  - **sender** (★3): Same sender within time window, but only when the email also overlaps with the reference topic
  - **keyword** (★2): Shared meaningful topic keywords from the subject/content
- Generic noise terms such as external/training/request are intentionally ignored during keyword extraction
- Sender and keyword matching are intentionally tighter to reduce unrelated same-sender and boilerplate matches
- Results sorted by relevance (confidence score)
- `--strategies`: comma-separated (default: all three)

### Contact Lookup (Use Before Search by Email)
```bash
py -3 scripts/outlook_skill.py lookup-contact "user@domain.com"
```
- Returns: Display name, company, job title
- **Why:** Outlook search by email address unreliable; use display name instead

### ReplyAll (default)
```bash
py -3 scripts/outlook_skill.py replyall "<email_id>" "<p>HTML body</p>"
py -3 scripts/outlook_skill.py replyall "<email_id>" "<p>HTML body</p>" --cc "extra@ibm.com"
```
- Keeps ALL original To + CC recipients. `--to`/`--cc` APPEND to existing.
- **This is the default reply command.** Use unless you need to narrow recipients.
- **⚠️ ALWAYS show draft to user first — NEVER send before user approval**

### Reply (specify mode)
```bash
py -3 scripts/outlook_skill.py reply "<email_id>" "<p>HTML body</p>"
py -3 scripts/outlook_skill.py reply "<email_id>" "<p>HTML body</p>" --to "specific@ibm.com"
```
- Replies to sender only. `--to`/`--cc` specify EXACT extra recipients (original To/CC NOT included).
- Use when you want to narrow the recipient list.

### Compose Email
```bash
py -3 scripts/outlook_skill.py compose --to "email" --subject "text" --body "<p>HTML</p>"
```
- **⚠️ ALWAYS show draft to user in chat window first — NEVER send before user approval**
- AI presents the email as readable plain text in chat
- Only call this command after user explicitly confirms "send" or "approve"
- Sends immediately when called

### Forward (single)
```bash
py -3 scripts/outlook_skill.py forward "<email_id>" --to "user@domain.com"
py -3 scripts/outlook_skill.py forward "<email_id>" --to "user1@ibm.com,user2@ibm.com" --cc "manager@ibm.com" --body "<p>FYI</p>"
```
- Forwards an email to specified recipients
- `--to` (required): Comma-separated list of To recipients
- `--cc` (optional): Comma-separated list of CC recipients
- `--body` (optional): Custom HTML message to prepend
- Subject auto-prefixed with `FW:`
- Preserves original email formatting
- **⚠️ ALWAYS show draft to user first — NEVER send before user approval**

### Batch Forward
```bash
py -3 scripts/outlook_skill.py batch-forward "<email_id>" "recipients.csv" --message "<p>HTML body</p>"
```
- CSV: single column named "email" (supports BOM encoding)
- `--message`: Optional HTML message to prepend (same format as reply)
- Uses BCC for privacy
- Preserves original email formatting
- Automatically splits large recipient lists into batches
- **Batch size:** Configured in [`backend/config.py`](backend/config.py) (default: 500)

### Get Full Email Details
```bash
py -3 scripts/outlook_skill.py get-email "<email_id>"
```
- Returns complete email: full body, all attachments, metadata
- Use after search/thread/related to read the actual content

## Configuration

All configuration is centralized in [`backend/config.py`](backend/config.py).

**To change batch size:**
Edit `backend/config.py` and modify:
```python
class BatchConfig:
    OUTLOOK_BCC_LIMIT = 500  # Change this value
```

**Batch size recommendations:**
- **500** (default): Recommended for production use
- **100**: For testing with smaller batches
- **1000**: Maximum (may hit Exchange server limits)

## HTML Format Examples

```html
<p>Dear John,</p>
<p>Message text here.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>Marlon</p>
```

## ⚠️ Special Characters in Email Body

**CRITICAL:** Replace `$` with `&#36;` in HTML body to avoid shell variable issues.

```html
<!-- ❌ WRONG: $80,000 displays as ,000 -->
<p>Cost: $80,000 USD</p>

<!-- ✅ CORRECT: Use HTML entity -->
<p>Cost: &#36;80,000 USD</p>
```

**Common HTML entities:** `$` = `&#36;` | `&` = `&amp;` | `<` = `&lt;` | `>` = `&gt;`

## Find Workflow for Email Addresses

1. Lookup display name: `lookup-contact "user@domain.com"`
2. Find by display name: `find --type sender --query "Display Name"`

**Why:** Outlook MAPI doesn't reliably search by email address

## Recommended AI Usage Flow

### Finding All Emails About a Topic
```bash
# Step 1: Start narrow and recent with a specific query
py -3 scripts/outlook_skill.py find --type subject --query "voucher approval" --folders "Inbox,Sent Items" --days 14

# Step 2: If not found, widen the time window but make the query more specific
py -3 scripts/outlook_skill.py find --type subject --query "voucher approval philippines" --folders "Inbox,Sent Items" --days 45

# Step 3: From any result, find the full thread
py -3 scripts/outlook_skill.py find-thread "<entry_id>"

# Step 4: For even more context, find related across threads
py -3 scripts/outlook_skill.py find-related "<entry_id>"
```

## Requirements

- Microsoft Outlook 2016+ (running)
- Windows 10+
- Python 3.8+ with pywin32
- SQLite 3.35+ (included with Python 3.8+)
